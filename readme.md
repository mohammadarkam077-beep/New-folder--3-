## 📝 Key Learnings
- Stock prices are **highly autocorrelated**
- Traditional ML models rely on **explicit or implicit historical features**
- **LSTM outperforms classical models** by learning temporal dependencies internally
- Feature leakage can artificially inflate performance metrics

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add **XGBoost / LightGBM**
- Multivariate LSTM (volume, indicators, macro data)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment using Streamlit or Flask
- Real-time stock prediction pipeline
